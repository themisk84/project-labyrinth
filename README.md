# Project Labyrinth
 In this week's project, which was a pair programming by Efthymios Karakasis ans Helena Wiklund, we have to build an text-based game app.

## The problem

The app is built with React and Redux. The app receives game actions from a backend API. We used thunks to get the information from the API and interact with Redux store.
